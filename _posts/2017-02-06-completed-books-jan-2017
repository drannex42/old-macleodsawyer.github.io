Every month I'm going to start listing every book that I complete. Last month includes 12 books that I started and finished in no particular order. 

**Inventing The Future: Postcapitalism and A World Without Work by Nick Srnicek**

This book surprised me, it's well written and well thought out. I have always believed that we are well on the path to postcapitalist system. Capitalism is creating socialism to keep itself alive, it's a great book that goes deeper into the concept and shows several different sides of the growth and change that the world will have from it. 

**Reform or Revolution by Rosa Luxemburg**

Rosa Luxemburg day was last month, and I wanted to have a refresher. Went to a local indie punk remembrance day with fellow like-minded people over at a place called Backspace that was absolutely phenomenal. 

**Delivering Happiness: A Path To Profits, Passion, and Purpose by Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh**

Focusing on customer service is the most important part of any business, without it your company will fail. Tony Hsieh shows how focusing on customer service grew Zappos from nothing to over a billion dollars in sales in 8 years because of it. 

**Rework by Jason Fried** 

**Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari**

Quite potentially the greatest and most riveting book I have ever read. Look through the history of humankind all the way from the beginning, not just biologically, but also environmentally, politically, and more. Will read again, and write a full review since it was that amazing. 

**Losing My Virginity: How I've Survived, Had Fun, and Made a Fortune Doing Business My Way by Richard Branson** 

Title is pretty self explanatory. 

**How To Make A Spaceship: A Band of Renegades, an Epic Race, and the Birth of Private Space Flight by Julian Guthrie** 

**How To Win Friends & Influence People By Dale Carnegie** 

**Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller by Ron Chernow** 

Started and finished this book in one day. All 1000+ pages. Read it on and off throughout the day and enjoyed every bit of it. There's a lot to learn about one of the most powerful tycoons of the 1800's. 

**The Idealist: Aaron Swartz and The Rise of Free Culture On The Internet by Justin Peters** 

Aaron Swartz is one of my biggest role models and has been for about five years. I already knew nearly everything in this book, but it showed so many different view points and everything that surrounded Aaron and his life, not just his success'. R.I.P. Aaron. 

**The Code of The Extraordinary Mind by Vishen Lakhiani**

**Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies by Nick Bostrom**

Didn't make it quite all the way through this one, it's pretty hard of a read and will have to reread this one quite a bit.
