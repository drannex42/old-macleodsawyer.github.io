I am tired of analytics dictating my emotions and my thoughts, I am going to bring back the idea of the "weblog" at least for my own sanity on my side. I'll explain [later](https://macleodsawyer.com/log/i-am-tired-of-analytics), too tired right now to really explain. 

Thanks.

***Edit:** I have written that post [here](https://macleodsawyer.com/log/i-am-tired-of-analytics)*
