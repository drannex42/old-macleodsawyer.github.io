I spent the last several days digging through forums, reddits, comment threads, and dozens of articles on repairing my frozen bootlooped Kindle Paperwhite. 

After consulting Amazon customer service they disclosed a tool that will forcibly do a system reset on reboot. 

Problem: Frozen and/or Bootlooped Kindle Paperwhite (or any other current generation Kindle E-reader). 

My device kept bootlooping **and would not** allow me to read anything. If you connected it to the computer you could view your files, ***I highly suggest you save all files in your kindle documents directory as this will delete everything on your Kindle.***

1. Connect Kindle to your computer (They suggest Windows or Mac OSC, but I completed this on Ubuntu 17.04) 
2. Navigate to the **root directory** of the Kindle by accessing your file manager and selecting the Kindle entry. 
3. Create a file titled `DO_FACTORY_RESET` without any file extensions attached to it. 
4. Now hold the power button for **forty seconds**. This will force a reboot. 
5. Wait. 
6. Wait..
7. Wait...
8. After you wait for awhile and it flashes a handful of times, the device will then take you to the "Language Selection" Wizard and you can set up your kindle just like it was brand new! 

If you have any other issues you can contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MacleodSawyerMD) or by contacting [Amazon Support](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/contact-us/general-questions.html?#) (I suggest using the "Chat support"). 

Hope this helps!
