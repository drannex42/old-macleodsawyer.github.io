Hello. My name is Macleod Sawyer and I am an internet activist, developer, robot, inventor, and entrepreneur.

# Entrepreneur?

I am the founder of IdeaDrops Biotechnologies which is working to make the world a better place through automating the entire agriculture market. 

I used to run a blog network of a million followers that I accumulated over three years, I've left that behind for my own sanity and happiness. I'll link to the post explaining why sometime soon. 

# Why do you do all this?

Honestly, because I'm bored and know I can build things that will make peoples lives easier and better. 

# Anything else?

yeah, I was built not born.
